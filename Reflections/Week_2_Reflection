# Weekly Reflection- Week Two

1. What have you accomplished this week? (Please list each accomplishment, and explain)
  I have created a new character and began work on their dialogue. I have added new optional objectives for the quest. I have created the reputation system needed to track the player's progress with certain optional objectives.
  
2. What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?
  I have had issues finding time to work. I have started to manage my homework better, so this should become less of a problem. I still need to finish up creating all the new objectives and dialogue functions, such as returning items to Mario's boss to satisfy optional objectives.

3. What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)
  I will finish up the optional objectives of the quest. This should take around three hours. I will add those objectives to the quest properly. This should take around three hours, including testing time. I will begin to create new areas for the quest to take place in. This will be the most time expensive task, and I am avoiding it until everything else is done. I assume this will take around four hours for each area.
  
4. What resources will you use to accomplish your goals for the upcoming week? (please list out the resources)
   I will continue to use the GECK wiki https://geck.bethsoft.com/index.php?title=Main_Page.
   I will also be using Seddon4494's tutorials as a resource https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8xg-EQk4U5AmkvBJfHGYDg.
