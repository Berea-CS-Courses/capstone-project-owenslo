# Weekly Reflection- Week Five

1. What have you accomplished this week? (Please list each accomplishment, and explain)
  * I have finished all of what I stated I would last week, except for the stretch goal, which I am cutting. These include decorations for the interiors, lighting for the interiors, and an indicator of outcome at the end of the quest in the form of a note.

2. What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?
  * I have had to begin preparing to move out at the end of the semester. I have been spending time with my friends since this will be the last time I see some of them.

3. What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)
  *  I would like to switch focus to my final presentation. I believe that I will just do a live showing of the features of my project. I am not sure if I have any S.M.A.R.T. goals this week other than preparing for the final presentation.

4. What resources will you use to accomplish your goals for the upcoming week? (please list out the resources)
  * I will continue to use the GECK wiki https://geck.bethsoft.com/index.php?title=Main_Page.
  * I will also be using Seddon4494's tutorials as a resource https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8xg-EQk4U5AmkvBJfHGYDg.
