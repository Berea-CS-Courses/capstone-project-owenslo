# Weekly Reflection- Week One

1. What have you accomplished this week? (Please list each accomplishment, and explain)
  I have broken down what I want to accomplish next with my project. I will expand the quest and the dialogue, I will add a reputation system to help with an optional objective, and I will create new areas. I believe the next six weeks will be enough time to flesh these ideas out so they can be an entertaining part of the mod.

2. What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?
  I have had issues finding time to work on most of my work, since all my classes have overloaded me at once. I have been trying to wake up early so I can have more time to do my class work. Beyond that, I have had no direct issues with my project.

3. What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)
  I will develop and implement t.he reputation system. This should take around three hours. I will start work on the areas where the quests will take place. This will take a few days. I will start writing more dialogue to give the quest and companion more character. This will take around six hours.
  
4. What resources will you use to accomplish your goals for the upcoming week? (please list out the resources)
   I will continue to use the GECK wiki https://geck.bethsoft.com/index.php?title=Main_Page.
   I will also be using Seddon4494's tutorials as a resource https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8xg-EQk4U5AmkvBJfHGYDg.
