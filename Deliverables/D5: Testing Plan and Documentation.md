# D5: Testing Plan and Documentation

0. I want to use this space to add references to the community fixes I'm using to get the game to work well. THESE FIXES DO NOT DIRECTLY EFFECT MY PROJECT, THEY ONLY EFFECT THE GAME ITSELF.

1. a) I plan on conducting the ad hoc and unit testing tests.
   b) These tests are best suited for my project because my project relies on usability and proper system intergration. The ad hoc testing will allow other players to attempt to play and find issues with my project while unit testing will make sure that all of the dialogue and quest scripting plays out as wanted.
2. My objectives with these tests are as follows: For unit testing, I want to make sure that the quest, scripting, and dialogue work as intended. To do that, I must interact with the NPCs, their scripting, and quest objectives to insure they work as intended. For ad hoc testing, I want the player to be able to complete the quest and be able to use Mario as a companion, regardless of any encountered bugs. Of course, I will encourage my testers to attempt to break my project so I can fix it.
