# Ideas
1. Modding Mario Nakazawa into Fallout: New Vegas as a companion.
1. Writing a piece of ransomware.
1. Writing a piece of “ethical” malware.


# A description of the ideas:

## Idea 1: 
I have always enjoyed working on creating custom content for Fallout: New Vegas. The modding tool for the game, the G.E.C.K. (Garden of Eden Creation Kit), is a tool used to access, add, modify, and delete anything in Fallout: New Vegas. Whether it be creating a new NPC or writing out an entire scripted sequence, the tool has been used by many to create new systems for the player character to interact with, intricate, scripted stories with hours of play time, and expansive new worlds that are radically different from the main game itself. I would like to test my skills with this tool, as this tool covers much of what I have been learning in the major, like coding, database management, project management, understanding how my creations will interact with and effect preexisting content, and testing my creations for quality assurance. Beyond that, I will also be working with things like level design and audio design, both of which I had only worked with in Game Design.

## The scenario: 
There are many follower mods available, but they are typically either incredibly serious or, bluntly, romantic fantasy. I have no interest in either topic, and I’m certain many others feel the same. On a personal level, I think Mario Nakazawa’s banter 
would be a good contrast for a game about surviving in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. This mod would be, realistically, for me as a test of skill and for something to be entertained by. But I could see how someone who wants to have a silly, semi plausible companion in a game that is lacking in that department would enjoy this.

## The Modality: 
This would be strictly software, as mods for Fallout: New Vegas exist in two types of files, the **.esp** (Elder Scrolls Plugin) and the **.esm** (Elder Scolls Master). The .esp file is the file where a modder would create most of their additions to the game. The .esp is always reliant on at least one .esm file to function, which would explain the .esm’s outdated name. The .esm is not editable directly, and relies on .esp files to modify it’s data. A .esp file can be converted to a .esm file, and vice versa.

## Enthusiasm: 
I would rate it at a 5. These types of things are not only something I have a passion for but are also something I have an advanced understanding of and I can comfortably challenge myself with.

## Idea 2: 
Since I was a freshman in high school, I have been interested in the world of computer viruses and malware. 2012 was an interesting time for malware, as most major malwares were only rogue antiviruses that annoyed the user into buying it. Soon, things started to change. Malware would start to evolve into things like browser/desktop lockers, often claiming to be the FBI to scare the user into paying a “fine,” or an early version of ransomware. Ransomware can be defined as any program that prohibits the user’s access to their own files, typically requiring payment to regain access to their files. Soon after this, malware authors would start to use file encryption to force users into paying cryptocurrency to get a decryption key to recover their files. Most notable of these types of ransomware would be WannaCry and Petya, which, in both cases, effected government systems, banks, and corporations around the world. I have always been curious as to how these types of programs are designed and would like to learn how to make one myself. I’m also interested in exactly how it would be written to build and trigger the payload and how it would communicate out to the author.

## The scenario: 
As in most cases, ransomware is typically unexpected and unwanted by the user who is infected with it. In this case, the ransomware would be created for study and test purposes. Creating a ransomware would be a great way to investigate the design choices that would go into it. It would also allow virus testers and software behavior analysts that work for antivirus companies to understand the behavior of ransomware and help find new ways to detect and stop ransomware before it has a chance to start damaging a user’s files.

## The Modality: 
Viruses and Malware perpetuate themselves in a number of manners, whether it be an .exe file that claims to be a program that it actually isn’t or macros in Word documents. Ransomware attacks have usually been perpetuated by sending spam emails to users who work for the target organization in hopes that one of the users will download and activate the file that is attached to the email, which is typically a .PDF file.

## Enthusiasm: 
For this project, 3. I am interested in the creation of ransomware, but I am put off by worries of finding help with the coding part of the project. The current pandemic would make it difficult for me to receive hands-on help and hands-on help is the best way for me to learn.

## Idea 3: 
The idea behind creating “ethical” malware is like the idea behind creating a piece of ransomware. I have always wanted to explore the topic of malware more and am interested in creating malware to learn how it would work. In this case, the malware I would create would benefit the user in some way, like being a warning to not download strange files from the internet or making sure the user has their firewall on and then providing suggestions to what kind of antivirus to use.

## The scenario: 
The “ethical” malware would perpetuate itself the same way as ransomware, to show users the ways one might get infected by real malware. This would also serve as a reminder that the user should be more careful and to not trust the idea that everything they download is exactly what they think it is.
## The Modality: 
This will be similar to how ransomware will work. It will be contained in specific file types. This means this will be software based, unless the malware is spread through an infected physical drive that is plugged into the user’s computer.
## Enthusiasm: 
I'd give this one a 4. I would face the same adversity as with this as I would with the ransomware, but I like this idea more, since this is less destructive and more instructive to the user.


# Preferred Idea

*The Mario Nakazawa companion mod.* This is, personally, something I find entertaining. Beyond that, it would be a good test of the skills I have been learning and developing throughout my time in the Computer Science major. This would also challenge me to grow and advance in some skills I’m not too familiar with. I also would not need much outside help for this project since I am already quite familiar and comfortable with the tool I would be working with.
